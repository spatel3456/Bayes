# Bayes

This repository goes with the research project I am currently doing with a faculty in the TAMU Statistics Department. In this project, we are looking at some of the applications of Bayesian Statistics in modern data manipulation and data analysis. We are particularly focused on using Bayesian Neural Networks to analyze giant datasets with multiple variables. You can find reports and coding pages in this repository.
